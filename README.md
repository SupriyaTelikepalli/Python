# Python Practice Projects

This repository contains basic Python projects for beginners, covering concepts such as Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) and functions. These are simple practice problems and do not involve any database connections.

### Projects:

1. **Budget Tracker** -
   The Budget Tracker allows users to manage their monthly budget by defining income and savings at the start of the month. Users can also add expenses, helping them track and manage their budget effectively. This project is developed using OOP concepts and is available in a multi-user version, providing a great opportunity to understand OOP principles in Python.

2. **Hangman** - 
   Hangman is a classic word-guessing game where the user has to guess a predefined word within a limited number of attempts. This project is developed using Python functions and is simple to build, making it a great practice exercise for beginners to understand the use of functions in Python.

4. **Tic Tac Toe** - 
   A user can play against the computer or another player in Tic Tac Toe. The player who successfully places three 'X' or 'O' symbols in a row, column, or diagonally wins the game. This project is developed using Python functions, offering a fun and interactive way to practice functional programming in Python.
